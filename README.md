# HTML5-CSS3-Video-Games-Project

This website project was individually built in the "HTML5/CSS3" course during the third semester of the Web Design and Development 
program at Baruch College.

The main objective of the the project was to apply the set of general rules learned during the course. Apart from using the HTML5 and CSS3
skills learned during this and other previous courses, I also used the skills (JavaScript and jQuery) learned in the "JavaScript and Ajax"
course to provide a more dynamic style both to the main layout (website) as to the other pages.
